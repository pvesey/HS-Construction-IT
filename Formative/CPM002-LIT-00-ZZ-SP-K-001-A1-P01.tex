\Large\textbf{Assignment 2 (40\%)- Project Scope Statement}\\
\end{flushleft}

In this assignment you will create a Scope Statement for a project of your choosing.  You do not need to choose a construction related project, however the scope statement must cover the key topics identified and discussed in lectures.  Your chosen project will require approval from me before you start.  The key deliverables for this project are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item A post of your proposal to the Assignment-2 Channel, maximum of 100 words, outlining your chosen project
	\item A detailed Scope Statement for your project, subject to an overall maximum of 1500 words, submitted via MS Teams
\end{enumerate}

\begin{large}
Suggested Approach
\end{large}


\begin{itemize}
	\item Choose a project from a domain that you are comfortable working within.  
	\item Refer to the lecture notes, and identity the key headings necessary for a comprehensive Scope Statement
	\item Keep your writing clear and concise.  Avoid the typical over-explanation common in academic writing.
	\item A Scope Statement is a live document.  Ensure your document layout is clear and allows for easy access to key sections. 

\end{itemize}
