\section*{Assignment Outline}


In this assignment you will create an on-line survey to capture the prestart checks undertaken by a site dumper operator.  The platform for the on-line survey is to be Microsoft Forms, which is available through your Office 365 Student Subscription.


\section*{Background Information}

The HSA has a published document for Site Dumper Prestart checks.  This document is available in the assignment pack, and is available for download \href{https://www.hsa.ie/eng/Publications_and_Forms/Publications/Construction/Site_Dumper_and_360_Excavator_Pre-start_Checks.html}{here}.  An image is also shown in Fig \ref{fig:DumperPrestartChecks}

\section*{Usability}

Your final survey is intended to be deployed on site, for usage checks by drivers.  As such you should consider the following in the design and implementation of your survey:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Questions should be short and easy to read
	\item Responses should be clear and unambiguous
	\item Where failures are detected by the operator, additional information should be captured
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section*{Functionality}

The following functionality must be included in your deployment:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Driver Name and Employee Number
	\item Dumper Registration
	\item All items as per the HSA document
	\item Appropriate Branching to capture comments on failed checks
	\item A branch specifically implemented for 'Use on Public Roads'
	\item A specific multi line input field for group testing feedback.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Testing}
Testing of your deployment will be done in two stages
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Author Testing - You should test your deployment rigorously before proceeding to the next stage
	\item Group Testing - Your Deployment will be tested by all other members of the class, and you will be expected to test all other deployments.
\end{enumerate}


\newpage
\section*{Group Testing Feedback}
Group testing will be implemented to improve your deployment prior to final submission. All feedback is to be:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Specific, meaningful \& constructive
	\item Impersonal
	\item Process Orientated
\end{itemize}

\section*{Submission}
This is a relatively complex submission, that will comprise many parts.  The parts are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Link to Microsoft Form (with a .txt file)
	\item Screen-shots of the form before group testing, numbered appropriately
	\item Screen-shots of the form after group testing, numbered appropriately
	\item Excel file containing all responses, including comments from group testing
\end{enumerate}

All parts are to be compressed into a single zip folder compelete with logical sectioning.  The link to the form URL can be included in a simple text file in the submission.
