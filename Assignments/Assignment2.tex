\section*{Assignment Outline}


In this assignment you will create a BIM360 Field Survey to capture a workplace audit.  The questions that are to be used are taken from \href{https://safetyculture.com/}{https://safetyculture.com/}, iAudior example survey.   Autodesk BIM360, which is available at \href{https://docs.b360.autodesk.com/}{https://docs.b360.autodesk.com/}.


\section*{Background Information}

In a previous assignment, you created a digital survey using Microsoft Forms.  In this assignment you will also create a survey, but this time the survey will be integrated into Autodesk BIM360 and used in assocuation with a Building Information Model.

\end{figure}

\section*{Usability}

Your final survey is intended to be deployed on site, for usage checks by drivers.  As such you should consider the following in the design and implementation of your survey:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Questions should be short and easy to read
	\item Responses should be clear and unambiguous
	\item Where failures are detected by the operator, additional information should be captured
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section*{Functionality}

The following functionality must be included in your deployment:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Driver Name and Employee Number
	\item Dumper Registration
	\item All items as per the HSA document
	\item Appropriate Branching to capture comments on failed checks
	\item A branch specifically implemented for 'Use on Public Roads'
	\item A specific multi line input field for group testing feedback.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Testing}
Testing of your deployment will be done in two stages
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Author Testing - You should test your deployment rigorously before proceeding to the next stage
	\item Group Testing - Your Deployment will be tested by all other members of the class, and you will be expected to test all other deployments.
\end{enumerate}


\newpage
\section*{Group Testing Feedback}
Group testing will be implemented to improve your deployment prior to final submission. All feedback is to be:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Specific, meaningful \& constructive
	\item Impersonal
	\item Process Orientated
\end{itemize}

\section*{Submission}
This is a relatively complex submission, that will comprise many parts.  The parts are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item BIM360 Template (hosted on 'Health \& Safety Project' on BIM360)
	\item 5 Checklists completed by other students using the BIM360 Smartphone App
	\item 1000 word report on the creation and deployment of the BIM360 survey, including data analysis, app screenshots, and other items as may be required.  This document is to be a fully detailed report submitted in .pdf format only.
\end{enumerate}
